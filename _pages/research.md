# Research

## Foundations for the Systematic Evolution of Digital Twins

The DarTwin project addresses the critical challenge of managing the evolution of digital twin systems throughout their entire lifecycle. While digital twins have become a cornerstone of Industry 4.0 and are essential for Industry 5.0, current research primarily focuses on specific lifecycle phases rather than providing comprehensive support for system evolution.

### Research Objectives

Our research is organized around three main objectives:

#### 1. Evolutionary Aspects of Digital Twin Systems

We investigate how digital twins evolve over time and adapt to changing requirements, environments, and operational conditions. This includes understanding:
- The nature of changes in digital twin systems
- How models, data, and services evolve
- The relationship between physical system evolution and digital twin evolution

#### 2. MetaTwins: Operationalized Workflows for DTS Evolution

We develop **MetaTwins** - operationalized workflows that address digital twin system (DTS) evolution systematically. MetaTwins provide:
- Structured approaches to managing evolution
- Workflow definitions for common evolution scenarios
- Integration with DevOps and model-driven engineering practices

#### 3. DT Systems Evolution Management

We create methods and tools for managing the evolution of digital twin systems, including:
- Evolution planning and decision support
- Automated evolution detection and adaptation
- Validation and verification of evolved systems
- Integration with existing development and operation processes

### Research Methods

Our approach combines:
- **Constructive Research**: Developing new methods, models, and tools for digital twin evolution
- **Empirical Evaluation**: Validating our approaches through case studies and real-world applications
- **Model-Driven Engineering**: Leveraging MDE principles for systematic evolution management

### Application Domains

Our research is applicable across various domains where digital twins are used, including:
- Smart cities and smart buildings
- Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS)
- Healthcare systems
- Industrial automation and manufacturing
